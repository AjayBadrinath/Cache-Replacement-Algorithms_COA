# Cache-Replacement-Algorithms_COA
These programs in this repository are implementation of various cache algorithms



# [Inclusions]



1.Direct mapping 


2.Associative mapping



3.Kset associative mapping



# [Experimental Approach ! Non standard Approach!]

4.Probablistic Model Approach (Yet to implement !!)[Bayesian model]

5.Frequeny Map Approach 

All these will be up here soon 

Essentialy they compute cache hit rates via different algorithms given a cache request sequence :)
