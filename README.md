# Cache-Replacement-Algorithms_COA
These programs in this repository are implementation of various cache algorithms



# [Inclusions]



1.Direct mapping 
2.Associative mapping
3.Kset associative mapping


All these will be up here soon 

Essentialy they compute cache hit rates via different algorithms given a cache request sequence :)
